const logo = ""
const defaultFrame = <a href="https://www.freepik.com/vectors/frame">Frame vector created by gstudioimagen - www.freepik.com</a>;
const background ='' /* background by SVGBackgrounds.com */

    //Ideal approach: Write a caption, social media post, sentence, paragraph, blog post, or entire book about how 
    //SVGBackgrounds made your life easier. Place this credit with link on a webpage dedicated to credits, blog post, or another suitable section of your website. E.g.: I customized the background on my homepage at SVGBackgrounds.com.

    //Minimal approach: Place credit in CSS code commented out near background - image code(example below).
